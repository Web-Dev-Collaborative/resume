  descr: "Coderdojo is a global volunteer-led community of free programming workshops for young people between 7 and 17. It was born 23 July 2011. I start with a local community since 2016. I am a mentor (teacher) or a guardian (assistant) depending on the needs. We organize small half-day events where the guys are the protagonists!"

- name: move my site from VM to IaaS
  descr: "Why do I have to keep a VM and/or some services for a simple blog or a static web page? Why do I have to reinvent the wheel when there are a lot of good provider that they do it for me? So what is the better provider for me? Well, I can manage all with GitHub, I can forecast a GitLab backup (or another provider) and when I can not manage with a Jekyll theme, I can deploy something on a cloud provider."
