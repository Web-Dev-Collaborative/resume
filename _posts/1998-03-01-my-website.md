I have a site since 1998. I changed more providers: cjb.net, xoom.it, tophost.it, hostmonster.com, .. then I needed a server and I chosen ovh.com, but I don't have any time for the maintenance. So I have chosen to move all on github.com and aws.com. I started with a static web site, then a dynamic web site by server side and now a dynamic web site by client site, by a static web site with API.
