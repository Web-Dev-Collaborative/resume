#### My iterative resume
This repository is my iterative resume theme powered by jekyll forked from the repository [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids).

What I done
- I forked the repository of [bilardi/leonids](https://github.com/bilardi/leonids)
- I followed this macro [gist](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/6b6cdcfabed5e5976ba697544be714d6) guide
- I saved the branch named leonids as my [sync](https://gist.github.com/bilardi/97d4098c2ff21065d2d29c715dcb3812) with the original repository
- I used the free icons of [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- I redirect resume page on homepage because the homepage is my resume
- I removed the original posts and moved the README.md of the repository forked into [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/bilardi/notes/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
- I wrote the contents like the mind map below
